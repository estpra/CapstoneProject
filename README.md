# CapstoneProject
Client-server program
===========================================================================================================================================================
Technical Information:

This is a client-server project that uses JavaFx as the Library for the GUI and Java for the backend of the GUI. A MySQL database was also created and
utilized in the project by utlilizing the JDBC driver to be able to connect and commumicate with the mySQL database from the Java project to store, update
and retrieve data. SceneBuilder was also utilized in order to more efficiently create the GUIs; scenebuilder creates 2 files, one java file(called controller 
class) and the other a .fxml file that keeps track of any effects or styles you apply to the GUI from within Scenebuilder.
The only file that isnt a java or .fxml file is the main app which runs the actual application and is a javafx application file.
